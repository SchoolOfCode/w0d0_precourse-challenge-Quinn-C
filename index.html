        <h3>A brilliant British mathematician who took a leading role in breaking Nazi ciphers during WWII. </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1912 - Born in Maida Vale, London, England.</li>
            <li>1925 - Attended the well-known independent Sherborne School, he became particularly interested in math and science.</li>
            <li>1931 - Enrolled at King's College (University of Cambridge) in Cambridge, England.</li>
            <li>1934 - Proved the central limit theorem, and he was elected a fellow at the school upon his graduation.</li>
            <li>1936 - Delivered a paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the â€œUniversal Turing Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable
                of computing anything that is computable: It is considered the precursor to the modern computer.</li>
            <li>1938 - Received his Ph.D. in mathematics and cryptology at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.</li>
            <li>During World War II - Made five major advances in the field of cryptanalysis, used to help decipher German encrypted signals.</li>
            <li>Mid-1940s - Began working for the National Physical Laboratory, designed work for the Automatic Computing Engine.</li>
            <li>Late 1940s - Turing went on to hold high-ranking positions in the mathematics department and later the computing laboratory at the University of Manchester.</li>
            <li>1952 - Charged with gross indecency due to the illegality of homosexuality in the UK at that time.</li>
            <li>1954 - Died at the age of 41.</li>
