# Why I chose this subject?
I chose **Alan Turing**, because he is a national hero and I want more and more people who doesn't have computer science background to know him. He is not only the code-breaker in World War Two, but also he is `the father of modern computer science`.


# What I learned through this challenge?
I have learned how to:
* add css style sheet in html file.
* set attributes in html tags.
* add unordered list, images, hyperlinks in the content.
* use css class.
* set up git and how to use git add, git commit, git push, git fetch, git rebase, etc.
* use Github page, it is better to name the html as index.html; otherwise, Github page will host the README.md file as default.
* use markdown to write README.md.


# Reflections on the development journey.


> Keep learning and keep solving problems!

It was a very enjoyable development journey. Although I encountered some errors, mistakes, etc., during this process, I found I can find the solutions of these issues from websites, such as stackoverflow, so that I can solve them quickly.
